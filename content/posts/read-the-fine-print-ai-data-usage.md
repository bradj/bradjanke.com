AI tools offer significant productivity gains. The cost isn't just your monthly subscription fee.

## What You're Actually Agreeing To

Most AI service terms allow companies to use your prompts and data for model training. Your code snippets, business logic, and sensitive information become part of their training datasets.

**Common Terms of Service Clauses:**

- Prompts and responses used for "service improvement"
- Data retention periods measured in years, not months
- Broad permissions for "research and development"
- Right to share data with third-party partners
- Minimal user control over data deletion

## Data That Gets Collected

**Beyond Your Prompts:**

- Usage patterns and timing
- File names and directory structures
- Error messages and debugging information
- Browser fingerprints and device information
- Integration data from connected services

**Metadata Matters:**

- When you work and how often
- What technologies you use
- How you structure projects
- Your problem-solving patterns

## Reading Privacy Policies

**Key Sections to Review:**

- Data collection and usage rights
- Third-party sharing arrangements
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Geographic data storage locations
- User rights and opt-out mechanisms

**Red Flags:**

- Vague language about "improving services"
- Indefinite data retention periods
- Broad third-party sharing permissions
- No user control over data usage
- Unclear data deletion processes

## Practical Protection Strategies

**Minimize Sensitive Data Exposure:**

- Remove API keys and credentials from code before sharing
- Use generic variable names instead of business-specific terminology
- Avoid sharing proprietary algorithms or business logic
- Review prompts for personally identifiable information

**Choose Services Carefully:**

- Compare privacy policies across providers
- Look for services with explicit data protection commitments
- Consider enterprise versions with stronger privacy controls
- Evaluate on-premise or self-hosted alternatives

**Regular Policy Reviews:**

- Terms of service change frequently
- Set calendar reminders to review policies quarterly
- Monitor for policy change notifications
- Understand grandfathering vs. new terms

## The Reality

AI companies build valuable services by collecting and analyzing user data. This data collection funds free and low-cost AI tools. Understanding this exchange helps you make informed decisions about which tools to use and how to use them.

Read the terms. Understand what you're trading. Make conscious choices about your data.
